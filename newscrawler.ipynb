On June 9, Dei had gone to the bank to withdraw Rs 1,500 that was deposited in accounts of women under Jan Dhan scheme to help the poor tide over the Covid-19 crisis under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan package.The branch manager had reportedly asked the woman that unless her mother comes by herself, the money can&rsquo;t be given.

              "  'The Karnataka government on Monday extended compulsory institutional quarantine to those coming in from Delhi and Tamil Nadu. Earlier, it was limited to just Maharashtra.People from the two states, Delhi and Tamil Nadu, will have to undergo institutional quarantine for a period of three days followed by 11 days of home quarantine, while those from Maharashtra will have to undergo compulsory one week institutional quarantine followed by one week of home quarantine. For people coming from states other than these three, it is two weeks of home quarantine.This and several other decisions were taken at a review meeting chaired by chief minister BS Yediyurappa, following concerns over increase in Covid-19 cases in the state.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Karnataka CM pointed out that of the 7,000 Covid-19 positive cases registered in the state till Sunday evening 4,386 were returnees from Maharashtra and an additional 1,340 were those in contact with them. Those who had come from overseas, only 216 were tested Covid-19 positive.&ldquo;Transmission is not happening because of movement within the state but because of people returning from other states and therefore we have to take these measures to contain it,&rdquo; he added.Yediyurappa also claimed that the state was doing significantly better than the national average. He said while the state&rsquo;s mortality rate was 1.2 per cent, the national average was 2.8 per cent. He also said that Karnataka had a recovery rate of 56.6 per cent against the national average of 51 per cent.Responding to a question on reimposition of the lockdown, the CM said if anything he would appeal to the PM for further relaxations. He said that strict enforcement would be done regarding social distancing, wearing of masks and use of sanitisers to maintain hygiene. He also said that for those caught not wearing masks for a first time offence, they would be fined Rs 200.As on Monday, the state had recorded 7,213 cases with 4,135 recoveries, 88 deaths and 2,987 active cases with Yadgiri, Kalburgi, Bangalore Urban and Raichuru accounting for bulk of the active cases.',\n",

              "  'The US&thinsp;Supreme Court rules gay and lesbian people can sue for workplace bias under landmark civil rights law.In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, saying that federal law prohibited discrimination based on sex as well as race, colour, national origin and religion, also applies to gay and trans people. The ruling comes as a major win for LGBTQ&thinsp;workers and their allies, many of whom have experienced discrimination at work or even been fired for being LGBT+, the ruling represents a watershed moment in gay rights.&ldquo;No trans people and no lesbian or gay people can ever be fired or discriminated against for being gay or transgender - that&rsquo;s the immutable law of the land now,&rdquo; said Vandy Beth Glenn, a trans woman fired in 2007 when she came out as trans.In his majority opinion, conservative justice Neil Gorsuch wrote: &ldquo;Ours is a society of written laws ... An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.&rdquo;LGBT+ advocacy groups welcomed the decision as an important step in protecting gay and trans workers, more than half of whom live in states without explicit workplace protections, leaving them vulnerable to harassment or firing without legal recourse.&ldquo;This is a landmark victory for LGBTQ equality,&rdquo; Alphonso David, president of LGBT advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign, said on Twitter.&ldquo;We cannot &amp; should not go back to a time when people felt they had to hide who they are in order to feel safe at work.&rdquo;The court&rsquo;s ruling comes days after the administration of President Donald Trump announced a rollback of guidance implemented during the administration of President Barack Obama which protected trans people from discrimination in healthcare. Trans rights advocate Carter Brown said if the Supreme Court ruled in favour of workplace protections, it would still require a cultural shift before trans people truly felt safe at work.The outcome is expected to have a big impact for the estimated 8.1 million LGBT workers across the country because most states don&rsquo;t protect them from workplace discrimination. The Trump administration had changed course from the Obama administration, which supported LGBT workers in their discrimination claims under Title VII.During the Obama years, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had changed its longstanding interpretation of civil rights law to include discrimination against LGBT people. The law prohibits discrimination because of sex, but has no specific protection for sexual orientation or gender identity.In recent years, some lower courts have held that discrimination against LGBT people is a subset of sex discrimination, and thus prohibited by the federal law.Efforts by Congress to change the law have so far failed.The Supreme Court cases involved two gay men and a transgender woman who sued for employment discrimination after they lost their jobs.As per a study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine by researchers at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut, &ldquo;Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents are at heightened risk of suicide, depression, sleep troubles, and eating disorders. These health consequences often stem from the distress of being stigmatized for their sexual and gender identities. Based on this knowledge, researchers wanted to learn whether being mistreated for other reasons (such as their weight, race/ethnicity, religion, disability status) also contributes to their health.&rdquo;The study also reports findings from the LGBTQ National Teen Survey, a comprehensive survey conducted in partnership with the Human Rights Campaign to assess victimization, health behaviours, family relationships, and experiences of LGBTQ adolescents across the United States. Researchers asked participants ages 13-17 questions about school-based GSAs, their experiences of bias-based bullying, and health risk indicators, including stress, sleep problems, depression, and unhealthy weight behaviours.-- with inputs from Associated Press, Thomson Reuters Foundation and ANIFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter',\n",

              "  'The WHO is still waiting for China to share the genome sequence of the virus extracted from infected samples, which were picked up by Chinese scientists over the weekend from the Xinfadi market soon after it was shut down.',\n",

              "  'The World Health Organisation (WHO), which has its country office in Beijing, is yet to send a team to the wholesale market linked to the sharpest spike in Covid-19 cases in China&rsquo;s capital city. It has been four days since the first infection was detected.The WHO is still waiting for China to share the genome sequence of the virus extracted from infected samples, which were picked up by Chinese scientists over the weekend from the Xinfadi market soon after it was shut down to the outside world.To a Reuters question whether China has shared the gene sequence with WHO, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said on Monday: &ldquo;China has maintained close communication with the World Health Organisation. As for the specific question you mentioned, I don&rsquo;t know the specific situation yet. Please inquire directly to the competent department.&rdquo;Beijing has logged in as many as 79 new cases since June 11, the most significant flare-up in a major Chinese city that is home to China&rsquo;s political and business elite.&ldquo;The WHO has not visited the Xinfadi market in relation to this cluster of Covid-19, with the first confirmed cases on June 11,&rdquo; the Organisation said in a statement to Hindustan Times on Monday, adding that it was receiving updates from the Chinese health authorities.Dozens of residential communities have been locked down, schools have been closed and emergency response levels are being gradually raised across the city&rsquo;s districts after the rapidly spreading cluster infection emerged from the sprawling market.Beijing is said to be preparing to test at least 90,000 people connected to the market and living in its neighbourhood.The Xinfadi Agricultural Products Wholesale market, which also deals in meat and seafood, is located some 25 km away from the WHO office in Beijing.Until Monday evening, the WHO, the UN&rsquo;s specialised agency for international public health, had only received briefings about the new and fast spreading cluster from Chinese health authorities &ndash; without any first-hand knowledge about a worrying infection that has resurfaced in Beijing &ndash; which had zero cases since April -- after a gap of 55 days.It was not immediately clear if Beijing is yet to give consent to the WHO, as per protocol, to send a team to the Xinfadi market in the southwest Fengtai district.The market was shuttered over the weekend and scientists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, experts from its Beijing centre and the national health commission (NHC) have scoured the market, picked up samples and conducted preliminary tests.According to state media reports, the virus was detected on a salmon chopping board.The WHO did not answer HT&rsquo;s query whether it had asked Chinese authorities to visit the market but said it was receiving regular updates from health authorities.&ldquo;The information thus far has come from Chinese national and municipal health officials, in briefings and exchanges with the WHO office in China and updates sent via the International Health Regulations mechanism,&rdquo; the statement said.&ldquo;In our exchanges, the WHO has received a briefing on the preliminary investigation, offered support and technical assistance. Chinese health authorities have agreed to continue to exchange further information about the cluster and the investigations underway and planned,&rdquo; the statement said.The organisation is yet to receive gene sequencing results.&ldquo;The WHO encourages the sharing of this and other sequences on a publicly available website as soon as possible. We await more genetic sequencing to see how close this virus is to others. We have asked China for the genetic sequencing and to receive new data on the epidemic as the investigation unfolds; and our counterparts are committed to continuing to provide such data. The WHO is following up with Chinese officials for further detail,&rdquo; the statement added.An Associated Press report released earlier this month said the WHO worked on minimal information during the beginning of the outbreak in China in December and January, alleging that Beijing was deliberately slow in sharing critical information.Both China and WHO denied it.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has praised China for &ldquo;setting a new standard for outbreak response&rdquo; through swift and aggressive measures.While the pandemic rages globally, China has sharply brought down the infection numbers across the country with the government saying that the outbreak has been effectively controlled, until the virus reemerged in Beijing last week.',\n",

              "  '&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what we do!&rdquo;Reuters photographer Dylan Martinez heard the words ring out during chaotic scenes in London on Saturday, when mostly peaceful anti-racist demonstrations turned into violent scuffles with counter-protesters in the area.Then he saw the man who had uttered them - a black protester emerging from the melee carrying an injured white man in a &lsquo;fireman&rsquo;s lift&rsquo; over his shoulder.The picture he took has gone viral on social media and featured in news bulletins, capturing a moment of high drama that jars with the broader narrative - of anti-racist and far-right protesters fighting each other.&ldquo;I saw a skirmish and someone falling to the ground,&rdquo; Martinez recalled of the moment near Waterloo Bridge, in central London, as he covered anti-racism protests that have flared up in the city.The two men then appeared through the crowd.&ldquo;The crowd parted right in front of me. I was in the right place at right time, and incredibly lucky from that point of view. He came towards me walking briskly.&rdquo;Martinez said the man being carried had injuries to his face, and Reuters journalists at the scene said he had been beaten in a skirmish with anti-racism protesters.Some people in the crowd shouted out that the assault victim was a member of the far-right.Reuters was not able to identify the victim or his political leanings. Police said they were aware of the incident and the photograph, but made no further comment when Reuters asked for details of the men&rsquo;s identity and what happened.Protests have erupted across British cities and around the world after a black man, George Floyd, died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.In some cases they have sparked counter-demonstrations by people who do not agree with all of their aims and methods, and these have included people from far-right groups.British media identified the black man as Patrick Hutchinson, a personal trainer. On his social media account, he wrote: &ldquo;We saved a life today&rdquo;.Reuters spoke to the partner of Hutchinson&rsquo;s best friend, who confirmed it was him. Hutchinson did not reply to calls to his mobile phone.He told British Channel 4 News on Sunday it was a &ldquo;scary&rdquo; scene. &ldquo;It was pretty hectic, it was almost like a stampede.&ldquo;...The guys went in there, they sort of put a little cordon around him to stop him receiving any more physical harm. His life was under threat.&ldquo;So I just went under, scooped him up and put him on my shoulders and sort of started marching towards the police with him whilst all the guys were surrounding me and protecting me and the guy I had on my shoulder.&rdquo;In a statement on Sunday police said 113 people had been arrested over the weekend and 23 officers were injured in the violence, none of them seriously.The reaction on social media to the picture and events it portrayed has been largely positive.&ldquo;Amid all the ugliness, a beautiful moment of humanity,&rdquo; wrote British journalist Piers Morgan in a Tweet accompanying the photograph.Martinez, a veteran photographer who is Reuters&rsquo; picture editor for the United Kingdom and Ireland, said the protests in London on Saturday had been fluid and unpredictable.After witnessing sporadic, minor clashes between demonstrators and police in Trafalgar Square, Martinez said he switched attention to nearby Waterloo Bridge, where several hundred anti-racism protesters had gathered.&ldquo;They took over the whole of the bridge,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There was a traffic jam going from south to north, but the vibe was good - cars were honking and people were celebrating.&rdquo;The mood quickly turned ugly when they encountered a group of counter-protesters and clashes broke out, Martinez said.',\n",

              "  'Natalie Bin Narkprasert&rsquo;s business was in Paris. But she was locked down by COVID-19 restrictions and stuck in Thailand.Her heart was in Thailand, too &mdash; and it ached for her compatriots who were suffering in the pandemic. She thought of her own grandmother.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s 94 years old, and then I really worried about her during COVID, like how is she going to cope and do things, so I just thought about all the people who are struggling during this time who might not even have a family or a home,&rdquo; she said.So she recruited a network of volunteers, including Michelin-starred chefs, to help those in her homeland whose already modest incomes were shattered by the pandemic restrictions.Her group, COVID Thailand Aid, says it has reached more than 30,000 people in more than 100 locations with care packages and freshly cooked food.On a recent afternoon, the 28-year-old was front and center in the Bangkok heat, helping distribute meals in a small, low-income community beside a railway line.In bright blue T-shirts, she and her volunteers pressed boxes of spicy minced chicken and rice into the hands of residents. They also gave essential items like clothing, hand sanitizers and face masks.Most residents are employed as maids, street vendors or shop assistants, and many haven&rsquo;t worked for around two months.&ldquo;It means a lot to us. We are facing difficulties,&rdquo; said Jintana Jantornsri, one of the community elders.   &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t even pay rent. Many have no jobs and can&rsquo;t sell anything. Everything is tough.&rdquo;   Narkprasert decided to help after flight bans stopped her returning to France, where she runs property and e-commerce businesses.She started out small, buying groceries for neighbourhoods in need, but now has more than 450 volunteers who pull together food donations and care packages in more than 32 provinces.Narkprasert is kept busy making appeals and fielding requests for help, then matching skills with needs, and sourcing goods, facilities and transport.The results are impressive. Included in her network is a string of top-rated Bangkok restaurants. For this day&rsquo;s mission, chefs from five eateries gathered at Bo.lan, which offered up its kitchen.They prepared 300 servings of pad krapow gai, spicy minced chicken, for the rail-side community.Three of the restaurants involved have earned Michelin stars, though that isn&rsquo;t the point, said Megan Leon, a Mexican-American cook and food writer who is the project leader for the food donation drives.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just about getting together to try to feed people and make sure people have access to good food and that will make them feel good about themselves and help families that are in need,&rdquo; she said.Narkprasert&rsquo;s business career has come to a sudden halt, and she hasn&rsquo;t seen her husband for months. But she says she has no regrets.She even thinks returning to her old life may be a challenge. This is, she said, &ldquo;a really hard time to go back to it just because I still have this goal of helping more people.&rdquo;   &ldquo;I can always make money later, but I just want to keep helping people for now and then we will see how it goes,&rdquo; she said.',\n",

              "  'Many may agree with the statement that dogs are a multifaceted species. Some may be known for the protective services they provide to hoomans while others are famous for their derpy shenanigans. Most doggos are so layered that they hold the potential of being strong and silly all the same time. This particular video showcases one such canine who is using its fighting skills of utmost proficiency against a somewhat goofy enemy. Posted to Reddit, this clip titled, &ldquo;My boy attacking the shadow monsters!&rdquo; is almost 40 seconds long. The recording shows a pooch on a beach with his hoomans. The pet parents use the sunlight, creating shadows on the sand to play with the canine. They move the dark reflection of their hand around a few times. The doggo tries to chase it. Then, the shadow monster moves on to grab the tiny paws of the pooch. The doggo, not having any of this, tries to retaliate to the best of his abilities. This derpyness goes on until the very end of the film. Since being shared on June 15, the post has amassed more than 5,200 upvotes and nearly 50 positive comments. Click To ExpandHere is how Redditors reacted to the share. One person said, &ldquo;Bamboozled&rdquo;. While another individual wrote, &ldquo;In his defence, they were clearly going to get him. He had to protect&rdquo;. The doggo had no choice but to fight the shadow monster, obviously. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s some quality derpiness,&rdquo; read one comment on the subreddit &lsquo;animals being derps&rsquo;.

              "  'When Niccolo Campriani left the shooting range at the Rio Olympic Games with the 50m 3-positions rifle gold around his neck, the Italian rifle marksman - one of the most successful Olympic shooters with three gold medals in two editions - was clear in his mind. He won&rsquo;t be firing competitively again. When Abhinav Bindra bowed out at the same venue in 2016, missing bronze by a whisker, the Beijing Olympic Games gold medallist in 10m air rifle too had made up his mind that he had fired his last competitive shot. Both had seen their &ldquo;passion turn into obsession&rdquo;. They could have trained endlessly, but it would have been bereft of enjoyment.&ldquo;When I started to shoot in 2000 at the age of 13, the focus was to go to the Olympics one day. After winning gold at the 2012 London Olympics, there was a void&hellip;. What next? So I kept shooting and passion became an obsession. Four hours of shooting became 12 hours and I could have gone on endlessly. But I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying what I was doing. My mind was made up that it (the Rio Games) would be the last competitive event of my life,&rdquo; said Campriani, as he unveiled &ldquo;Taking Refuge&rdquo;, a five-part series partnering Bindra, which premiered on the International Olympic Committee&rsquo;s (IOC) global media platform, olympicchannel.com, on Monday.The series traces the 500-day-long journey of three refugees from the moment they set foot at an archery venue in Lausanne for a trial in 10m air rifle, and the progress they&rsquo;ve made to achieve their goal of competing at the Tokyo Olympics. For Campriani, the project was born out of the &ldquo;urge&rdquo; to do something for the refugees.&ldquo;After competitive shooting, there was a big void in my life. The global refugee issue is very close to my heart and when I moved from Italy to Lausanne, Switzerland, the blueprint was clear.&rdquo; Campriani had known that a refugee team had competed at the Rio Olympics and he wanted to take a few refugees under his wings and train them so that they could make it to the Tokyo Olympics.Eleven young refugees residing in Switzerland came for trials. Of them, three - a boy from Afghanistan and two women, one from &ldquo;a Middle-eastern country and another from an African country&rdquo; were shortlisted. They would by trained by Campriani himself at an archery venue in Lausanne and Abhinav Bindra at his foundation in Bengaluru in 10m air rifle. The target was to make them a part of the refugee team that would compete at the now-postponed 2020 Olympics.&ldquo;I was touch by Campriani&rsquo;s project, his determination and I was determined to help. Nico and I are really excited about the project. He wants the project to be taken forward by more athletes in other disciplines and I am all for it,&rdquo; says Bindra, adding, &ldquo;We want to change the lives of the athletes involved (in the project). We want to create a legacy.&rdquo;With three refugees onboard &ndash; Mahdi (Afghanistan), Khaoula (Middle-east) and Luna (Africa) &ndash; Campriani set out to experiment. It had taken him eight years to make it to the Olympics in Beijing but he wanted them on the global stage in just 500 days. &ldquo;The idea came to me sitting with a Starbucks coffee in hand and the next day I was at it,&rdquo; says Campriani.More than a year on, Luna has got married and has a three-month-old child to take care of, while Mahdi and Khaoula continue to train, though still not sure they will get a chance to go to Tokyo or not. &ldquo;There are about 50 shooters vying for berths in the refugee team for Tokyo. Though Mahdi and Khaoula have achieved MQS (Minimum Qualification Scores), they are not assured of a berth. With the Tokyo Games postponed, we still have 364 more days to train them,&rdquo; says Campriani.For Campriani and Bindra, it&rsquo;s not just about getting the two to Tokyo but also about opening a channel where more refugee athletes can get better opportunities and facilities to achieve sporting excellence. Bindra&rsquo;s project &lsquo;Make A Mark&rsquo; is helping refugee athletes transform their lives through sport. &ldquo;We require money, crowd funding and sponsors to make it happen... help the Mahdis and Khaoulas achieve sporting excellence,&rdquo; says Bindra.For Campriani, the bigger objective is to give refugees a new, positive identity. &ldquo;The perception is they just don&rsquo;t do anything&hellip; they just sleep and eat. I want to change that.&rdquo;',\n",

You always ask yourself if you should carry on together a bit longer or whether you should avoid that one year too many,&rdquo; Leonardo told the newspaper. &ldquo;But, yes, we&rsquo;re reaching the end. We must make a logical decision, in economic terms or with a view to the next generation.&rdquo;The 33-year-old Cavani has netted 200 goals in 301 games since joining for a then-French record 64 million euros ($72 million) in 2013.But Mauro Icardi&rsquo;s successful loan spell from Inter Milan this season prompted PSG to sign him permanently on a four-year deal, pushing Cavani closer to the exit.The 35-year-old Silva has played more than 300 games since joining from AC Milan.Once considered by some observers as the best center half in the world, the Brazilian has looked sluggish and error-prone in the past two seasons.In a 4-4 draw away to struggling Amiens in February he was taken off at halftime after being regularly turned and caught out of position.',\n",

When the first one was finished, essentially it had been three fantastic years of my life, but I needed to recharge on something else.

On June 9, the commission had in an amended calendar informed that the PCS (Mains)-2019 exams will be held from July 25.The UPPSC mains exam was initially proposed to be held from April 20, but was postponed due to Covid-19 outbreak in the country.Explaining the reason for this change, UPPSC exam controller Arvind Kumar Mishra said that Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has scheduled Civil Services 2019 interviews in July and the commission did not want any candidate who was set to appear in PCS (Mains) 2019 and had also qualified for Civil services 2019 interview to face any problem. The Civil Services exam 2019 interviews are scheduled to start from July 20.The UPPSC decision has brought relief to candidates who had appeared in PCS (Mains) 2018 and qualified to appear in PCS (Mains)-2019. They were demanding that UPPSC should declare PCs 2018 (Mains) and interview results before conducting PCS (Mains)2019.However due to lack of adequate time this seemed to be a tough ask. With PCS (Mains) 2019 being moved from July to August, the possibility of UPPSC being able to declare the final results of UPPSC Mains 2018 exam before conducting the 2019 edition of the exam seems possible.',\n",

Angadia couriers primarily ferry diamonds, gold ornaments and cash belonging to traders from one place to another. They mostly operate between Mumbai and various cities in Gujarat.The multi-task staffer of the income tax department was accused of conspiring with outsiders, who posed as income tax officers and carried out a fake raid on the angadia courier. Justice Bharati Dangre granted pre-arrest bail to the staffer, Jyotish Kumar Sinha, on Friday primarily because the other accused in the case have been granted bail by a sessions court and a substantial part of the of the money that was stolen has been recovered.Police in Lokmanya Tilak Marg registered a first information report (FIR) in connection with the offence and booked Sinha along with some others, including an income tax officer and an informant of the department identified as Premchand Jaiswal.According to the FIR, at about 5.30pm on December 2, 2019, seven to eight people barged into the courier&rsquo;s office, claiming they were income tax officers. They asked the firm&rsquo;s employees to sit in a corner and took away their mobile phones. The gang escaped with the office with more than Rs15 lakh and about 20 mobile phones. Soon after the fake raid, employees of the firm realised the members of the raiding party were not income tax officers and that they had been robbed, and one of them filed a complaint with police.Assistant public prosecutor Veera Shinde opposed Sinha&rsquo;s pre-arrest bail plea, pointing out that CCTV footage collected during the investigation showed that the multi-task staffer was present near the building and was seen conversing with the main accused, Premchand Jaiswal, who was arrested. She also said that call data records showed Sinha was in touch with Jaiswal and income tax officer Gautam Mehta, also an accused in the crime.The argument, however, failed to impress the judge, who noted that the Fir referred to seven to eight people barging into the courier company&rsquo;s office and described four of them by referring to their clothes and their physical appearance. &ldquo;However, no identification parade, which was imperative, was admittedly done,&rdquo; said the judge.',\n",

An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.&rdquo;LGBT+ advocacy groups welcomed the decision as an important step in protecting gay and trans workers, more than half of whom live in states without explicit workplace protections, leaving them vulnerable to harassment or firing without legal recourse.&ldquo;This is a landmark victory for LGBTQ equality,&rdquo; Alphonso David, president of LGBT advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign, said on Twitter.&ldquo;We cannot &amp; should not go back to a time when people felt they had to hide who they are in order to feel safe at work.&rdquo;The court&rsquo;s ruling comes days after the administration of President Donald Trump announced a rollback of guidance implemented during the administration of President Barack Obama which protected trans people from discrimination in healthcare. Trans rights advocate Carter Brown said if the Supreme Court ruled in favour of workplace protections, it would still require a cultural shift before trans people truly felt safe at work.The outcome is expected to have a big impact for the estimated 8.1 million LGBT workers across the country because most states don&rsquo;t protect them from workplace discrimination. The Trump administration had changed course from the Obama administration, which supported LGBT workers in their discrimination claims under Title VII.During the Obama years, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had changed its longstanding interpretation of civil rights law to include discrimination against LGBT people. The law prohibits discrimination because of sex, but has no specific protection for sexual orientation or gender identity.In recent years, some lower courts have held that discrimination against LGBT people is a subset of sex discrimination, and thus prohibited by the federal law.Efforts by Congress to change the law have so far failed.The Supreme Court cases involved two gay men and a transgender woman who sued for employment discrimination after they lost their jobs.As per a study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine by researchers at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut, &ldquo;Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents are at heightened risk of suicide, depression, sleep troubles, and eating disorders. These health consequences often stem from the distress of being stigmatized for their sexual and gender identities. Based on this knowledge, researchers wanted to learn whether being mistreated for other reasons (such as their weight, race/ethnicity, religion, disability status) also contributes to their health.&rdquo;The study also reports findings from the LGBTQ National Teen Survey, a comprehensive survey conducted in partnership with the Human Rights Campaign to assess victimization, health behaviours, family relationships, and experiences of LGBTQ adolescents across the United States. Researchers asked participants ages 13-17 questions about school-based GSAs, their experiences of bias-based bullying, and health risk indicators, including stress, sleep problems, depression, and unhealthy weight behaviours.-- with inputs from Associated Press, Thomson Reuters Foundation and ANIFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter',\n",

              "  'Researchers have shed light on the practical advantages of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or short bursts of all-out exercise for people who have experienced spinal cord injuries (SCI).While many studies have proven the benefits of HIIT for the able-bodied, much less is known about its impact, for better or worse, on the SCI population.Published online in the journal Spinal Cord, researchers from the Department of Kinesiology at McMaster University McMaster, the USA, and the UK have weighed the evidence regarding the overall health benefits, potential adverse effects, and feasibility of interval training for people with SCI.Researchers found HIIT and sprint interval training (SIT) improve cardiorespiratory fitness in people with SCI to a degree that appears to match longer bouts of moderate-intensity exercise.Importantly, the population is generally able to tolerate both HIIT and SIT, and there have been very few reports of harm from this type of training, the researchers have found.&ldquo;This may be especially relevant in the in-patient rehabilitation environment, where newly injured people with SCI spend a number of weeks before being discharged to the community,&rdquo; said Audrey Hicks, a professor in the Department of Kinesiology and one of the lead authors of the study.&ldquo;During this time, the patient&rsquo;s days are extremely full, with physiotherapy, occupational therapy, functional training, and exercise training, all with the goal of optimizing transition to the community. The time demands are enormous, so more efficient forms of exercise can be particularly attractive,&rdquo; she added.Spinal cord injuries typically lead to reduced physical activity, which in turn leads to other health problems such as a decline in fitness, muscle atrophy, increased body fat, and increased risk for heart disease and diabetes.Hicks and her team have shown in a previous study that a program of SIT three times a week for five weeks is as effective in improving indices of cardiorespiratory fitness as traditional moderate-intensity exercise and takes a fraction of the time to complete.She says it is now to learn more about the feasibility and implementation of HIIT for people with spinal cord injuries because that form of training requires quick transitions between higher to lower intensity exercise, which poses challenges for those with limited mobility.&ldquo;It is important to encourage more research to be done to establish safe guidelines for its implementation in this population,&rdquo; Hicks added.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

              "  'While exercising is proved to be beneficial for everyone, a recent sheds light on the benefits of performing light physical activities and its importance for older people.Understanding the benefits of moving more often and engaging in even lighter forms of physical activity is important for older adults&rsquo; health. These types of physical activity may be easier for older adults to practice regularly, especially those who are frail.A team of researchers was interested in studying how participating in these different intensities of activity, and whether a person spreads their physical activity throughout the day, affects the chances for developing a major mobility disability.The participants in the study were older adults who had challenges with physical function and who participated in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study.The researchers published their study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.The LIFE study examined whether a long-term exercise program could improve a major mobility disability. For the purposes of the study, the researchers considered that participants had a &ldquo;major mobility disability&rdquo; if they were unable to walk 400 meters (about one-quarter of a mile, or five city blocks).The people in the study ranged in age from 70 to 89 years old. Before the study, participants got less than 20 minutes of exercise a week, were able to walk 400 meters in less than 15 minutes, and were determined to be able to safely participate in the study.The participants were divided into two groups: an exercise group and a group that received health education with no exercise. By the sixth month of the study, the participants in the exercise group performed an additional 40 minutes a week of moderate to vigorous exercise, which they continued after 12 months and 24 months.The focus of the exercise program was on aerobic activity (exercises that increase your breathing and heart rate), specifically walking. Participants had a goal of completing 150 weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise paired with brief balance, flexibility, and lower-body strengthening exercises.Participants aimed to exercise five to six days per week, including two weekly centre-based exercise sessions. For the few weeks of training, participants advanced from exercising at a light intensity to a walking intensity they felt was at least &ldquo;moderate.&rdquo;Of the participants, 818 were randomly assigned to the exercise program and 507 individuals had &ldquo;accelerometer&rdquo; information at the beginning of the study. An accelerometer is similar to a pedometer, but it measures both amount and intensity of physical activity.The researchers found that the intensity of physical activity, as well as the way that physical activity is spread throughout the day, should be matched to each individual&rsquo;s physical health to minimize their likelihood of developing major mobility disability.First, they recommend that frail individuals focus on building strength and balance as a key step in preventing mobility disability. Next, as strength and balance develop, older adults should focus on increasing the amount of moderate to a vigorous-intensity physical activity they do each day through activities like working around the home, walking for transport, or purposeful exercise.Once individuals develop strength and balance and engage in at least a small amount of moderate to vigorous activity, they can further reduce their risk for mobility disability by increasing the amount of light activity they do each day, and by spreading this activity across the full day, for instance through hobbies like cooking, woodworking, or light gardening.The researchers concluded by echoing the current United States Physical Activity Guidelines, suggesting that a &ldquo;move more, more often&rdquo; recommendation is a good starting place for older adults who want to maintain physical functioning and an independent lifestyle.

              "  'Political parties are embracing technology to reach out to their workers, and voters, in times of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. A report in this newspaper, on Monday, outlined how the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been quick to adopt digital tools to launch a series of rallies over the past week. The aim of these rallies is to reach 25,000-50,000 people. Each rally involves meticulous planning, from regular calls with party workers on the ground to providing them basic technical training. The BJP was among the first parties to understand the power of social media and it is no surprise that it has now become the first party to innovate with mass e-rallies. The BJP is also using these rallies to push out its report card of how the government has dealt with the Covid-19 pandemic, at a time when there is growing criticism about its missteps in handling the health and economic crises. If the Opposition wants to put up a robust critique of the government&rsquo;s performance, it would do well to launch its own mass communication efforts. But this is not just about a particular party. There is no doubt that in the new emerging normal, there will be a shift in the nature of political communication. Parties must adhere to norms of social distancing; they must be responsible and not put their workers &mdash; and voters &mdash; at risk by organising large rallies; and travel and mobility should be confined to essential activities. These methods of campaigning can also have the advantage of reducing costs for parties, and perhaps allow those without resources to organise huge rallies to participate in the political discourse. The advantages of the digital mode of political outreach should be leveraged. But there are concerns. These campaigns are primarily top-down in nature. At live rallies, in smaller group discussions, and when leaders have to be on the ground, there is also a degree of bottom-up communication. Local workers and voters get a chance to convey their concerns, problems faced by their constituency, the social dynamics in a particular area, and outline their needs. It is important that digital communication is not just reduced to the political leadership telling people what it wants to convey, but also incorporates feedback from the ground. Otherwise, the already existing disconnect between voters on one hand, and political parties on the other, can deepen.',\n",

              "  'Bollywood Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide in Mumbai on Sunday. His tragic death has trigged a much-needed conversation on mental health in India. According to the World Health Organization, over 90 million Indians, or 7.5% of the population, suffer from mental health issues. A study published in The Lancet in December 2019, titled The burden of mental disorders across the states of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990&ndash;2017, also highlights the scale of the challenge. Mental health issues are among the leading causes of non-fatal disease burden in India; one of every seven Indian was affected by mental health issues in 2017; the proportional contribution of mental health to the total disease burden has almost doubled since 1990; and suicide was the leading cause of deaths among young people &mdash; aged 15 to 39 &mdash; in 2016. India spends little on mental health care. In financial year (FY) 2019, the budget allocated to the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) was brought down to ₹40 crore from ₹50 crore in FY18. Budget 2020 has not increased the allocation for NMHP. When it comes to mental health care personnel, India has 9,000 psychiatrists, or one doctor for every 100,000 people, when WHO norms say there should be three for every 100,000 people. While these structural and financial lacunae need to be addressed, it is important for society to not stigmatise the victims, and provide a community support structure so that they don&rsquo;t battle such problems alone. As the reportage on Rajput&rsquo;s death showed, the media, especially television, needs to be responsible, considerate and humane about the way it covers deaths due to mental health issues.',\n",

This is not an insignificant number. These craftspeople constitute a highly-skilled workforce, with huge knowledge of specialised processes, learnt from master craftsmen, who ran guilds over centuries, of complex designs. It was in the 1960s that I discovered the art of gold embroidery in a rural setting, in small villages in West Bengal, where the craft was being practised. It is said that the origin of the craft was Iran, and it came to India during the Sultanate. The embroideries from these villages were once  patronised by the Nawabs of Bengal. India is replete with village workshops like these, which cannot survive without financing and infrastructure.After the coronavirus pandemic, the reality is that the handloom and handcraft sector in India needs a way to survive. There is no relevance today in government-run emporiums.Our philosophy is completely wrong. A superior handloom product, aesthetically appealing as well as ecologically-friendly, cannot be sold out of compassion but needs the modern technology of marketing and retailing, and needs to be projected as the best  in the world. This is the only way to survive in a competitive market.A fact not commonly known is that the textile sector is the second largest employer in rural India, after agriculture. India was the world&rsquo;s largest supplier of textiles 200 years ago. By 1947, this was converted into a nation using copies of its own textiles, in bulk from England&rsquo;s industrial areas. This bankrupted India&rsquo;s rich craft economies is causing destitution in India&rsquo;s rural markets.It is a miracle that post-Independence, due to the government&rsquo;s efforts to revive  heritage crafts, India has been able to recreate many of its forgotten textile crafts. This was forward-thinking at its best and was not easily achieved. It took a sustained and progressive, revival movement to save India&rsquo;s handmade legacy. This was successfully launched with a series of the &ldquo;Viswakarma&rdquo; exhibitions, which displayed the sophisticated creations of this revival in prestigious museums. The programme generated a great degree of excitement, and the affluent middle-class became the biggest patron of these textiles. This was unlike in many other countries where priceless textiles were relegated to dusty museums. In India, these creations, and not fashion from the international ramps, became aspirational garments for urban consumers, especially women.In an effort to create interest in Indian crafts internationally, the &ldquo;Vishwakarma&rdquo; exhibitions were exhibited through the Festivals of India in the most-prestigious museums around the world capitals. This highlighted the richest traditions of handcrafts left in the world. This again caught the attention of the fashion fraternity abroad. India was once again on the world fashion map. Over the last two decades, the Indian fashion industry has made strides. And unlike the rest of the world, it boasts of an indigenous team of designers. These do not necessarily mean only those who show on the ramps, but also those present in the rural fields. They are weavers, embroiderers and creators of embellishments, which no one in the world can create. Most of Indian couture and its glamorisation can be attributed to the handmade crafts. In India, the garments from maharajahs and  royal pageants serve as a theme to Big and Small Indian Weddings. Their imitations have flooded malls, boutiques, village haats and bazaars across smaller markets. Each has its own version, creating a theatrical, Indian ethnic fashion. With the recessionary trend that the pandemic is causing, it is time for the government to step in, as they did in the 1950s, to save India&rsquo;s handicrafts. The drop in the retail of high-end merchandise will temper the scale of celebrations. Most high-end production will move from hand-made to mechanised alternatives.The world today produces textiles using sophisticated machinery. India&rsquo;s vast repertoire of designs may end up being used only as an inspiration, as is the case with China, which produces copies of the woven Benares saris, among a host of other textile merchandise, and sells these at a fraction of the price to India. This has destroyed the  handloom market in Varanasi. After the pandemic, we have a real problem of livelihood on our hands here, as well as one of the intellectual property of textiles which is facing a real threat. The government has to think outside the box, step in and support start-ups. This is a lucrative market. It can be run and marketed by a professionally-run organisation, with cutting-edge pricing, which also offers retail spaces on the internet. The only way to do this is to become a conduit to the customer to buy directly from the craftsman which would involve minimal overheads. It can easily be achieved. Let us look at the USP of this sector. Handicrafts can be best generated in agrarian set-ups. They do not necessitate a move from the rural to the urban scenario, hence avoiding the ghettoisation of its inheritors.It requires little  investment in production infrastructure or skill development. It will be the only Made in India by Hand brand in the world.Ritu Kumar is a fashion designerThe views expressed are personal',\n",

              "  'The coronavirus pandemic has impacted every sector, but perhaps, the travel, tourism and hospitality sectors have been most affected. Which is why, with the proper compliances, safety and sanitisation measures, and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for responsible reopening being issued, these sectors should now resume. The time for recovery is around the corner. In his Independence Day speech last year, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi emphasised the importance of making India a global hub for tourism, urging each citizen to visit 15 tourist destinations in India by 2022. With an inward focus on travel, we must convert this into an opportunity and advance our domestic tourism and hospitality sectors. Travel, tourism, and hospitality have an immense multiplier effect on the economy. These are sectors that can exponentially create jobs, and India needs high-quality job creation now. Travel and tourism has employed more than 42 million people in India or accounted approximately for 8.1% of the total employment opportunities. Last year, it contributed 9.3% to India&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and received 5.9% of total investments. It can accelerate the path to 9-10% annual growth and add millions of high-quality jobs each year. This is necessary, given that 72% of India&rsquo;s population is below 32 years, and the average age is 29. Tourism is the perfect fit for the future generation.India is ranked third in the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC)&rsquo;s Travel and Tourism Power Ranking, which assesses 185 countries on the basis of four key sector ingredients: Total travel and tourism GDP, foreign visitor spending, domestic spending, and travel and tourism capital investment. India is now ranked behind only China and the United States (US). The World Economic Forum conducts a biennial study across 14 vital parameters, and India has improved by 12 places over  the last two years, now ranking 40th out of 136 countries in terms of travel and tourism competitiveness. This is encouraging and makes the sector an essential cog to the New India growth story. The sector is relatively untapped. An added aspect of the travel and tourism sector is that not only does the sector provide high-quality jobs and countless synergies, it also enhances investment into India, accelerates development, and showcases India&rsquo;s unique treasures.Systematic tourism promotion campaigns will be important in the near future. There are two that I have helmed, which brought the spotlight on India&rsquo;s attraction for tourists. Incredible India and God&rsquo;s Own Country blended potential with awareness, allowing Indian entrepreneurs, global entities, domestic and foreign tourists, and the government machinery to work together and accelerate growth in the sector. A domestic-focused Incredible India 2.0 that showcases what the nation offers to Indians could be the post-pandemic plan for the sector. India, after all, has amazing diversity, from 38 Unesco World Heritage sites to the Himalayas to pristine beaches, and plenty of other natural assets. Besides that, India&rsquo;s achievement in tiger population conservation has led to a rise in the tiger population to 2,967 in 2018 from 2,226 in 2014. This is an increase of 741 tigers or nearly 25%, making India home to around 70% of the world&rsquo;s tiger population.  Prior to the pandemic, work on transportation to allow access to many of India&rsquo;s hidden treasures was paying off. The UDAN scheme has been a huge success, and now the government can focus on the earlier plans of launching 100 tourism-oriented trains. Also adding to the ease of access is the work that has been done on highways, roads, and ports, highlighted by the Bharatmala and Sagarmala projects. There has also been work done to enhance airport capacity and expand regional connectivity. The Airports Authority of India has estimated capital spending targets of more than ~20,000 crore by 2022, and more than 70 regional airports that are under-utilised will be developed. The Holistic Island Development plan is an ambitious policy directive focusing on the Andaman &amp; Nicobar (A&amp;N) and Lakshadweep Islands. It addresses tourism-based projects that automatically create jobs for the islanders, and enhance connectivity through key infrastructure projects. Until the pandemic, the restaurant industry was a dynamic sector. Expect to see them rebound, starting with Unlock 1.0, with delivery services such as Zomato and Swiggy having been involved in essential goods deliveries and maintaining the supply chain for food delivery throughout the lockdown. India has recently become a major player in the culinary ecosystem, making restaurants a ~4,25,000 crore market. They create millions of jobs and have a massive multiplier impact as well. Travel and tourism will be the key driver for high-quality employment and unparalleled sustainable growth for the next 30 years. Despite challenges, as we responsibly reopen, the opportunities for the sector to help growth will continue to increase, and the domestic demand will help build confidence in the sector&rsquo;s revival. The pandemic has only altered the progress, not stopped it. A responsible and phased recovery is imminent, and there is no better time for it than now. The positive impact of the sector will span all the downstream and upstream benefits that accompany growth in this sector. This has the potential to become the biggest job creator for India.

              "  'This has been a difficult three months for India. The policy response to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the lockdown has forced it to confront long-ignored realities about the Indian economy &mdash; its fragility, regional and spatial concentration and deep structural inequity. It also made visible sources of precarious resilience. Agriculture and associated supply chains, for instance, held together despite significant disruption and fall in demand. Now, as India unlocks and the focus shifts to repair and reform, policy debates must contend with these realities. India cannot repair and reform without acknowledging its economic failures. Doing so places accepted pathways for growth, shaped by the 1991 moment, back in contention. Coming off the stifling restrictions of the licence raj, the need to get the State out of the way was central to the 1991 imagination. Deregulation, market competition and opening up were the key mantras. This was a necessary element for economic reform. However, in its exuberance, the push for a smaller State failed to recognise that deregulation was not about State exit but about a changing role for the State and building a new economic regulatory architecture. This required more, not less, investment in State capacity &mdash; human resources and institutional systems, including processes for public accountability and dispute resolution. The pre-pandemic slowdown was, in part, a consequence of this failure to build regulatory capacity; our post-pandemic reforms run a similar risk.Consider the three agricultural ordinances promulgated earlier this month. The underlying objective to liberalise agriculture markets and give farmers greater choice is welcome. However, experience in states such as Bihar point out that deregulation, without investments in markets, does not automatically spur competition. Rather, this risks the proliferation of brokers. Infrastructure for wholesale agricultural markets is woeful and farmers have few avenues to directly sell produce. According to government estimates, India needs more than 3,500 wholesale markets and its 23,000 rural periodic markets need urgent infrastructure upgradation. Opening up agricultural markets to greater competition must also be accompanied by State investments in creating market infrastructure, information systems and building credible and responsive regulatory institutions that enable fair exchange and trade. This is in no way unique to agriculture. Across key sectors and in core factor market reforms, the State has a critical role to play.However, regulatory capacity is only one part of the challenge. As the lockdown shows, markets in India operate in a context of deep structural and regional inequalities. These inequalities necessitate State interventions in infrastructure, in incentivising supply chain investments, managing risk and enhancing bargaining power. This is where the State has been at its weakest. The State&rsquo;s failure to build these markets lies in an economic imagination that viewed the economy in false binaries that emphasised trade-offs between farm vs non-farm, rural vs urban, formal vs informal. In pursuit of an economy that was non-farm, urban and formal, it failed to understand the deep links across these binaries and design responsive policy. This is best illustrated in the approach to agriculture and growth. Consider the following: First, where agriculture has been invested in, agricultural surplus has played an important role in driving industrialisation and moving people off the farm. The history of India&rsquo;s industrial hubs such as Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu, which grew on the back of agrarian capital are testimony to this. Second, half of India&rsquo;s manufacturing value addition and off-farm employment (Census 2011) is in rural areas. Third, urbanisation is fuelled by changing economic patterns in these rural areas as non-farm employment increases. Half of India&rsquo;s new urban population growth between 2001-2011 (Census 2011) is in these rural areas that morphed into towns. Agriculture, non-farm rural and urbanisation are inextricably linked. In the policy preoccupation with moving people out of agriculture, the economic narrative failed to recognise these interlinkages treating agriculture as a residue, a drag on the economy and rural, non-farm and urban as silos. We have separate agriculture, rural, urban and micro, small and medium enterprises departments and no mechanism for strategic planning and coordination across them. Urban policies and spending has prioritised &ldquo;smart&rdquo; cities and metropolises rather than investing in small towns (many of which are still classified as rural) and cities where the bulk of economic activity takes place. Local governments, which ought to play a critical role, are weak, leaving behind largely the more pernicious elements of the license raj State that exploit the very inequalities the lockdown made visible.Addressing India&rsquo;s structural inequalities and making markets genuinely competitive requires an integrated economic framework, which breaks silos and invests in the continuum of agriculture, rural, non-farm and urban. This means investing in and incentivising State capacities to collect better data on agriculture, non-farm sectors, and urbanisation, for decentralised, local economic planning and investment. Finally, the lockdown must lay to rest the old debate on trade-offs between welfare and growth. Welfare, because of its political imperatives, was always treated as an afterthought in the post-1991 imagination, a compensation for the failure to bring people in as active participants in the economy. As is well recognised in economic literature, robust welfare builds human capabilities, enhances productivity and most importantly ensures dignity. Welfare needs to be re-imagined as the foundation of a strong economy and the capabilities needed for delivering welfare must be enhanced. If India is to find its way back on a growth trajectory, economic policymaking will need to acknowledge the failures of its past. Yet, our current reform imagination, as indicated in the Covid-19 economic package, remains trapped in false binaries and old frameworks. India&rsquo;s economic imagination needs to be refocused on the real economy. Crucially, growth needs a robust and capable State across all levels. Investing in State capacity and its regulatory institutions rather than wishing the State away will ultimately be the real driver of growth.

              "  'A clearly defined, accurately depicted and accepted boundary is essential for exercising sovereignty within the nation state, and the process starts with mutually accepted broad contours of where the boundary should lie followed by a political agreement to refine and define it. The boundary is then subjected to delineation, which essentially implies drawing on the map where the boundary runs, and finally demarcation by identifying and marking on the ground with natural features and boundary pillars.Where such an exercise is not considered critical, politically or economically, and both nation states find it expedient to let the ground reality prevail, the concept of frontiers emerges wherein both states exercise control up to a general line, leaving an opaque zone or buffer ensuring avoidance of confrontation or conflict.Finally, boundaries can be defined by natural features such as rivers, watersheds and prominent landmarks or artificially by latitude and longitude reference.Colonial Britain addressed boundaries and frontiers from the perspective of imperial interests and not securing lasting sovereignty for a unified India. Consequently, except where a direct threat from a neighbouring power suggested demarcation so as to draw the inviolable line, the British were content to declare major stretches as frontiers. While the McMahon Line came near to defining the generally accepted alignment of the Indo-Tibetan boundary in the eastern sector, the western sector remained the major bone of contention.INHERITED BRITISH LEGACYPost the First Anglo-Sikh War and under Article 4 of the Treaty of Lahore on March 9, 1846, the Lahore Durbar ceded all territories between the Beas and Indus rivers to the British and Article 12 in turn rewarded Gulab Singh with &lsquo;independent sovereignty&rsquo; of these territories. The Karakoram in the north and its extension south-east was the extent of the Sikh Empire when these treaties were concluded.William Johnson, an official of the Survey of India, while at Leh en route to Khotan in 1865, came up with the advanced boundary line of the Kashmir state without any serious physical survey. This extended the ceded territories of the Sikh Empire eastwards to the Kun-Lun watershed, encompassing Aksai Chin. It found expression in the Survey of India map of 1868.In 1893, Hung-Ta Chen, the Chinese official at Kashgar, handed a map showing the proposed boundary to George McCartney, the British consul-general at Kashgar. This showed the border along the Karakoram mountains, which was a natural boundary up to the Indus river watershed. The British presented this line, known as the Macartney-MacDonald Line, to the Chinese in 1899 through Sir Claude MacDonald, the British representative at Peking. The Chinese did not respond and it was taken as accepted. The boundary had more or less reverted to the extent of the ceded territories of 1846. In 1962, the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army advanced up to the 1899 MacDonald Line and is generally now the Chinese claim line as was also articulated in 1959.Based on imperial British cartographic declarations of shifting boundaries in the western sector, India inherited and chose to persist with the whole of Aksai Chin being part of erstwhile Kashmir state integrated into India. While the analysis, views and theories doing the rounds of academic circles and seminars may suggest the long term strategic purpose of Chinese actions and the threat to India, the fundamental objective is to bring around an agreement on the contours of the boundary, of course as perceived by the Chinese, so as to set the path for delineation and demarcation.EXPANSIONIST POWERDiplomacy by its very nature is designed for sugar-coated compromise. It is no substitute for, and is inversely proportional to, hard national power. Under the Sino-Indian Border Peace and Tranquillity Agreement (BPTA), 1993, the two sides agreed to call the entire disputed border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which in fact became a frontier; liable to alteration by force and with the hope of delineation. After 22 rounds of talks by special representatives, nothing appears to have been reconciled. Chinese incursions have been generally glossed over and presented as a peaceful diplomatic solution.China today is an expansionist power with historical grievances, much like Germany in the 1930s, blatantly disregarding treaties and conventions. Such powers have always been balanced by coalition of alliances or building corresponding power to resist and address the asymmetry. Our neglect, unwillingness and incapacity to invest in creating such corresponding power, and our ideologically and morally driven non-alignment precluding alliances fore-closes these options. With both avenues closed to address this expansionism, the future holds humiliation behind the fa&ccedil;ade of diplomacy.COURSE AND CONSEQUENCESIrrespective of the political dispensation in power, our national security issues are a matter of exaggeration and magnification of minor tactical actions by the ruling party and any setback, actual or perceived, is painted as a sell out by the opposition leaving no scope or ground for serious and pragmatic debate for resolution with national interest in focus. Then there is the Indian Parliament 1962 resolution to recover every inch of Indian territory from China making any seriously negotiated settlement nearly impossible.For six decades, we have wished away the reality. Emotional hyper nationalism is no substitute for comprehensive national power and sober handling of national security issues. What then is the solution to this logjam? Do we have the will and wherewithal to force the issue? Can we shed the ideological baggage or impractical resolutions? If not, then perhaps a practical and honourable accommodation with China remains a pragmatic option. Zhou Enlai&rsquo;s proposal of 1960 and Deng Xiaoping&rsquo;s of 1982 need serious consideration free from and above bindings.The nation and the political leadership are free to choose what course to follow but would not be free from the consequences of the choice.lgnsbrar@gmail.comThe writer is a former chief of staff at Leh-based 14 Corps and deputy chief, integrated defence staff.

              "  'In addition to its diverse achievements as the world&rsquo;s largest social welfare programme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has the unique accomplishment, which has got highlighted in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), of getting new putative fathers and mothers, new ownership and inventorship claims, and the twin triumphs of wisdom by hindsight and selective amnesia.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)&rsquo;s ministers and eminent functionaries are living down the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi&rsquo;s jibe of  &ldquo;monumental failure&rdquo; against his present jewel in the crown, the MGNREGS, by semantic hair-splitting that he meant to improve and enlarge it. Still others are characterising the current MGNREGS debate as a desperate attempt by Sonia Gandhi to claim false ownership. They forget that the same &ldquo;monumental failure&rdquo; jibe was repeatedly recast by today&rsquo;s ruling powers of today, and members and chairperson of the erstwhile National Advisory Council (NAC), which conceptualised MGNREGS, were called &ldquo;jholawallahs&rdquo;. Why should those who are derisively classified by the current political masters as &ldquo;urban Naxals,&rdquo; &ldquo;Left-leaning armchair socialists/communists&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Khan Market gang&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lutyens&rsquo; elite,&rdquo; not take credit for something which neither the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) nor the BJP, nor even the Congress thought of  for six decades, is beyond comprehension. Some government critics tend to use words that suggest that the Congress and NAC claims to it are akin to admitting to a crime.The scale of  MGNREGS is huge. As of  March 31, this legally guaranteed provision of work upon demand (a singularly innovative concept in itself) to anyone in designated rural areas, has, from inception, touched the lives of 120 million people,  provided 1,200 crore of  person days of employment, paid out wages aggregating thousands of crore, spread over 1.46 million diverse items of  rural work, of which 60% are complete, up and running. It is not surprising, because for the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and NAC, programmes such as the Right to Information, the mid-day meal scheme, the National Rural Health Mission, the food security Act, among others,  were articles of faith, not opportunistic ploys.Equally amusing is the reference by the eminence grises of the government to ownership claims of platforms such as the Jan Dhan  Yojana as the reason for MGNREGS&rsquo;s success. They omit the affectionate terms of endearment their own leaders used for the seminal Aadhaar scheme, which has been operational since 2009. Despite Aadhaar being the heart and soul of the Direct Benefit Transfers (DBTs),  it was termed by BJP legislator Meenakshi Lekhi as a &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; programme in 2012, adding:  &ldquo;This is a dangerous programme to regularise the illegal stay of migrants in the country. Is Bharat Mata so open to illegal migrants?&rdquo; The late Ananth Kumar argued: &ldquo;If you illegally enter other countries, you are shot at or put in jail. But if anyone illegally enters India, he is given citizenship. This is the contribution of Aadhaar....Aadhaar is the biggest fraud in the country.&rdquo; Such opportunistic political gaffes, whether qua MGNREGS or Aadhaar or the Goods and Services Tax will continue to haunt their authors, despite the fragility of institutional memory.Individual opportunism apart, institutional memory cannot efface the admitted fact that DBT was started in January 2013, and was formally announced in the budget of  2013. Fact checkers who trashed the BJP&rsquo;s claims of authorship of  DBT were ignored, and in 2017 PM claimed: &ldquo;We started direct benefit transfer scheme. This resulted in money reaching to its rightful owner. We successfully eliminated middlemen.&rdquo;The government has rightly allocated an additional Rs 40,000 crore as a Covid-19 fiscal stimulus to MGNREGS. Indeed, this is one of its main fiscal, Covid-19 components, while 90% of the remaining is misleading monetary policy, supply side announcements, clumsily camouflaged as being a fiscal stimulus. The UPA government kept increasing allocations every year to MGNREGS since its inception. In FY 2009-10, Rs 16,000 crore was allocated to the scheme. The next year, it was increased by 150% to Rs 39,100 crore. This government&rsquo;s apologists who are misleading the national discourse should point out a single year of such significant increase by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the last six years. It appears that Modi 1.0 and 2.0 have averaged an annual 12.8% increase in MGNREGS allocation, which is much less than the lowest increase by UPA 1 and 2.American author Maxine Kingston rightly said: &ldquo;In a time of destruction, create something.&rdquo; The original parents of such beneficial social welfare schemes have no problem if their success spawns new parents and new ownership. But during the &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; wrought by the virus,  why is this government maintaining a strategic silence regarding the increase of  MGNREGS&rsquo; from 100 days to 200? Why are we not at least attempting to move closer to universally paying minimum wages under MGNREGS? Why is the government not clearing its dues of Rs 16,000 crore, which reduces its actual claimed MGNREGS package of one lakh crore rupees to Rs 84,000 crore? Why are ministers hiding the fact that instead of 100 days, the ground reality suggests the fulfilment of barely 75 days in many cases, even 50 in some? Why can the government not enhance the boundaries of this successful scheme to six months or to the end of the pandemic? Why has this fear of fiscal deficit and/or the terror of downgrades by rating agencies paralysed this government, which does not seem to be aware of elementary concepts such as monetising debt to liberally fund lifeline schemes such as MGNREGS?It is only when you achieve, even partially, the above imperatively urgent reforms to MGNREGS that the nation will at least consider recognising you as adoptive, not biological, parents of the scheme.Abhishek Manu Singhvi is a third-term sitting MP; former Chairman, Parliamentary Standing Committee; former additional solicitor general, senior national spokesperson, Congress, and a jurist.
